# videogame_golden_age

This project was my guided project to complete my Data Analyst in SQL carrer track in DataCamp.

I developed all the coding to find answer for what year was the golden year for the videogames industry.

The dataset provided consists in 2 tables:
  game_sales:
    column        type       meaning
    game          varchar    name of the video game
    platform      varchar    gaming platform
    publisher     varchar    game publisher
    developer     varchar    game developer
    games_sold    float      number of copies sold (millions)
    year          int        release year
    
  reviews:
    column        type       meaning
    game          varchar    name of the video game
    critic_score  float      critic score according to metacritic
    user_score    floar      user score according to metacritic
